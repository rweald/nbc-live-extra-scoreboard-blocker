# NBC Live Extra Scoreboard Blocker

Don't you hate it when you see the score of an event that you were going to watch the full replay of later?
I sure did, so I built this simple chrome extension that blocks the scoreboard from the top of the [NBC sports live extra](http://stream.nbcsports.com/liveextra/) page. 

##Installation

* Simply clone this repository

* Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

* Click "Load unpacked extension" 

* No longer see the score of games you wanted to watch later!
